## Lab Purpose and Components
Since javascript classes and class methods had yet to be covered in detail, that was the focus of lab 6.

## What I Learned
Classes were yet another somewhat challenging topic to handle, but the lab was a slow, relatively simple walkthrough. By completing the lab, I felt like I had a good wide and shallow understanding of why classes are used and what they can do.
